#A, B and C are classes 
#A is a super class. B is a sub class of A. C is a sub class of B.  

#Create three methods in each class, 2 methods are specific to each class and third method (override method) should be in all three Classes A, B and C 

#Create a class with main method. 
# Create an object for each class A, B and C in main method and call every method of each class using its own object/instance. 
#Call an overridden method with super class reference to B and C classâ€™s objects
